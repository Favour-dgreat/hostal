Great submission. Follwing up with Emmanuel Review, I optimized the contracts by removing reducdancy in some functions, added Event structures, updated some functions that includes saving hirer address and timestamp for hiring the service and lots more. For the UI, I fixed the Available Equipments and Trainers bug to show the numbers, display service hire details onlick of the hire metric button and other optimization to ensure proper usage of the contract.
